            <p>Redundant data
                Data that appears in more than one place.
                
                NULL
                NULLs are markers indicating the lack of a value, which is confusing to work with.  NULLs are not equivalent to zero.  NULL values cannot be removed entirely from a database as they define optionality.
                
                Functional Dependency
                Normalisation has one semantic concept; functional dependence.  The primary key determines all other data items.  Non key items must depend on the key, the whole key and nothing but the key.
                
                DRY
                Normalisation does not directly apply to anything outside of databases. The principles of normalisation are quite specific to relational databases.  However the general underlying theme, that you shouldn't have duplicate data, can be applied broadly in software engineering. This is the DRY principle (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).
                
                
                Normal Form Levels
                There are a number of normalisation levels from 1st normal form through Boyce Codd level to 15th normal form.  Each normal form describes how to remove of some specific problem, usually related to redundancy. 3NF is appropriate for most professional applications.  The problem solved by normal forms above 3NF are quite rare problems, so chances are that your schema is already in 5NF.
                
                Note: You can remember the first three normal forms by the terms
